Practice: Importing Modules 
Instructions 
In this practice, you will use require to import and use both custom and built-in 
Node.js modules to create a simple task manager application. This activity focuses 
on reinforcing the concept of modular programming and the use of require to 
connect different modules. 
Preparation 
1. Create a new project folder named task-manager. 
2. Inside the folder, create the following files: 
○ taskManager.js: A custom module for managing tasks. 
○ fileHandler.js: A custom module for saving and reading tasks from 
a file. 
○ app.js: The main file that will import and use the other modules. 
Tasks 
1. Create the taskManager.js Module: 
○ Define and export the following functions: 
1. addTask(tasks, task): Adds a new task to the task list. 
2. listTasks(tasks): Logs all tasks to the console. 
2. Create the fileHandler.js Module: 
○ Use the fs (File System) built-in module to define and export the 
following functions: 
1. saveTasks(filePath, tasks): Writes the tasks to a file in JSON 
format. 
2. loadTasks(filePath): Reads and parses the tasks from the file. 
If the file doesn’t exist, return an empty array. 
3. Use the Modules in app.js: 
○ Import the custom modules (taskManager.js and fileHandler.js) 
and the path built-in module. 
1 
○ Implement the following functionality: 
1. Load existing tasks from a file named tasks.json. 
2. Add new tasks to the list. 
3. List all tasks. 
4. Save the updated task list back to the file. 
Requirements 
● Use require to import all modules. 
● Test the program by adding, listing, and saving tasks.
